# OOP-LAB-3
<p>I added the classes for Consumables and put Food, Medicine and Drink under it. It cleared up the code greatly.</p>
<p>Then I added the Enemy class and put Raider and Mutant under it. I override Mutant's Combat method in order to inflict radiaton damage rather than physical on the player.</p>
<p>Then I added a superclass called Object and made everything traceable</p>
